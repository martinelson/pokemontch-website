    <h6 class="intro-p">In the past couple of years, the popularity of Pokemon cards has increased significantly. In the midst of the
pandemic on top of some special 25th year anniversary promotions, I even found my old collection and bought
some cards off eBay myself. I was curious which cards were the most valuable and how the values varied across different
types of cards. Below is the beginning of this analysis. If you're interested, checkout my Github link for the full
scope of this project, which involved scraping pokemon price data, and a regression analysis which you can also view
here.</h6>

<h1>Prices per Card Type</h1>

{% include 'set-charts.html' %}

<h6 class="desc-p"> In the Pokemon trading card game, there are a few main categories of cards as detailed above.
    As expected, the Pokemon Card Type is by far the most valuable card type with a $14 average lead in terms of value.
    Whether it be for collecting or actually  using in the TCG, intuitively, this makes sense. The majority of cards
in a pack are of the Pokemon card type, with a lot more variability and art design surrounding the cards. It's why
you open a pack to begin with - to see which rare pokemon is at the end waiting for you. What was more surprising
was the Stadium card type being in second, followed by the Supporter cards. Promotional cards such as Champion's
Festival, and Tropical Beach put significant weight to the Stadium category. In general, the promotional sets tend
to give more value to the non-pokemon card types. It is worth noting that Hidden Fates: Shiny Vault is listed twice in
the top five for Supporter and Stadium cards, which was a fairly recent set. As full art supporter cards become more
popular, it could be interesting to see how that impacts the price, and the printing decisions for these types of
cards in the future.</h6>
